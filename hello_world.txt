sup people, life is a weird experience, what is this? what are we? what is this goo, this soup of cells we swim in?
We who are healthy are so lucky to be whole and have functioning bodies and minds.

What is the universe, what is nothing, is it really possible for there to not be anything at all. And then if something is not, it can only exist in oposition with what is.
for otherwise there would simply be a "NOT" without the "BE" there would only be negative space. 
Is there life after you stop working? how could there be anything? Once a clock breaks down it becomes parts of a whole that is no longer functioning.
And the parts themselves are not independent. Your mind is in your brain. If your brain gets damaged your experience of existing will be different.
There can only be a you as long as you work. Once that stops, there will never again be a you. It will be like falling asleep forever, no dreams, no more
waking up. Which is very sad, but unfortunately likely true, even though there's no real way of knowing for sure.
